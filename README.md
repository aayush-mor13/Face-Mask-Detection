<h1> Face Mask Detection using CNN </h1>

<p>This project is a Face Mask Detection system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model classifies images into "Mask" or "No Mask" categories based on a manually created dataset. The dataset was augmented using transformations like rotation, zoom, flipping, and brightness adjustments to improve generalization.<p>

<h3>📂 Dataset</h3>
<p><ul><li>The dataset was created manually with real-world images.</li><li>The dataset is not publicly available due to privacy concerns. However, the project supports any custom dataset with a similar structure.
